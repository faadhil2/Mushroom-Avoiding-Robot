# Mushroom-Avoiding-Robot

This robot was built to traverse a fictional world where giant magical mushrooms grew. 

In this fictional world, the robot is tasked to gather a mushroom of a specific shape, while avoiding the other mushrooms. There are 3 different variations of mushrooms, which only one of them was to be gathered. We tested our robot to gather these mushrooms by creating mushrooms using lego blocks with the given dimensions. Our first attempt was to use physical sensors to sense the mushrooms by contact, however we found it inconsistent. We finally resorted to using 4 ultrasonic sensors at different heights to measure the distance between the robot and the mushroom and different heigh levels of the mushroom. This allowed the robot to detect and geometry of the mushroom and decide whether to gather it or avoid it. This was part of a school project.
